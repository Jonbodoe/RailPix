Some things worth noting:

- I havent added user's choice of adding google maps or not, only the photos that have the google maps will be the first 4 posts.
- The pages are not fully responsive past < 700px width of the screen. The focus of the project was to understand PHP / MySQL

Structure:
- Assets folder: common HTML elements such as navbar, footer, etc. No php logic or js.
- Data folder: files that grab data from the database or other php logic that are occuring without the database
- Img folder: all the files that are used and uploaded are in this file, when creating an account you can re-use these images
